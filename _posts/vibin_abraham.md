## Current Projects

**A Size Extensive n-body Tucker method**

- Currently working on improving the [n-body Tucker](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jctc.7b00696) ansantz using perturbative corrections.

**Predicting the Multi-Exciton stability using Simple Spin Hamiltonians**

- Used the Ovchinnikov Rule for ground state multiplicity of molecules to predict boundness of covalentlyi-linked singlet fission dimers.([link](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jpclett.7b02476))
